  "content": "Geeky Kids helps children learn through hands-on STEM kits, workshops, and memberships. Their Shopify store was a fast way to launch, but it became a bottleneck as their offerings expanded. Product pages did not explain learning outcomes, bundles were hard to manage, and the team spent too much time on manual updates.\n\nTekniLabs partnered with Geeky Kids to design a new AI-first website that goes beyond ecommerce. The goal was to make the website a learning companion for parents and a growth engine for the business.\n\n## The challenge\nShopify worked well for selling single products, but it struggled with the depth of the Geeky Kids catalogue. The team needed:\n\n- A clearer way to match kits and workshops to a child’s age, interest, and skill level\n- Better storytelling around learning outcomes\n- Less manual admin work around memberships and bundles\n- A platform that could evolve as new programs launched\n\n## The approach\nTekniLabs rebuilt the website with a flexible content system and AI-driven guidance so parents could find the right option quickly. Key improvements included:\n\n- An AI-powered quiz that recommends kits and workshops based on age, interests, and learning goals\n- Content modules that highlight skill development, project examples, and outcomes\n- A membership hub that centralises schedules, resources, and renewals\n- Automated email sequences for onboarding and follow-up\n- A custom analytics layer to track learning intent, not just sales\n\n## Why move beyond Shopify\nThe new experience needed deeper logic than a standard product template could provide. By moving away from Shopify, Geeky Kids gained:\n\n- Full control over how programs are structured and presented\n- Easier management of bundles, memberships, and recurring content\n- Integrations that connect the website with internal operations and marketing tools\n- A platform designed for long-term flexibility\n\n## Outcomes\nWithin the first weeks, Geeky Kids saw immediate benefits:\n\n- Parents spent more time exploring program content and outcomes\n- Quiz recommendations drove higher conversion on memberships and bundles\n- Admin time dropped as onboarding and follow-up became automated\n- The team gained clearer insight into what families were looking for\n\n## What an AI-first website means\nFor Geeky Kids, AI is not just a feature. It is a way to personalise learning journeys, reduce decision fatigue for parents, and keep the site relevant as new programs launch. The website now acts as a guide, not just a store.\n\n## How TekniLabs helped\nTekniLabs led the full discovery, strategy, and build. We worked with the Geeky Kids team to map their programs, build the AI recommendation flow, and craft content that supports learning outcomes. The result is a modern, AI-first website that scales with their mission.\n\nIf you are outgrowing a template platform and want a website that works like a smart system, TekniLabs can help you plan the next step.",
